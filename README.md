# Scrollify

Scrollify. Trigger simple actions on scroll.

## A Note on the Possibilities

There are several things you might want to do upon user-scroll. This ES6 class provides a few basic	things, such as "pinning" an element, parallax-ing it, or toggling a class on/off. You can also easily create your own custom plugin effects.


- **Pin**: sticks an element to a particular point and holds in there for a
	pre-defined number of pixels.
<li><strong>Parallax</strong>: move stuff on scroll. A subtle effect that transistions elements
	more slowly (or perhaps quickly) than the speed of the user-scroll.</li>
<li><strong>Toggle</strong>: turn a CSS class on or off if the element crosses a particular
	threshhold on the page.</li>
<li><strong>Custom</strong>: you can easily add your own custom effects, which may include various
	transformations, rotations, etc.
